      <i><p class="p"><b>Probability Sampling:</b> <br>
        - <b>Simple Random Sampling:</b> Each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected. <br>
        - <b>Stratified Sampling:</b> Population is divided into strata, and samples are taken from each stratum. <br>
        - <b>Systematic Sampling:</b> Every kth member is selected from a list after a random start. <br>
        - <b>Cluster Sampling:</b> Population is divided into clusters, and random clusters are selected for sampling. <br><br>
      
        <b>Non-Probability Sampling:</b> <br>
        - <b>Convenience Sampling:</b> Participants are selected based on their easy availability and willingness to participate. <br>
        - <b>Snowball Sampling:</b> Participants refer others to participate in the study, creating a "snowball" effect. <br>
        - <b>Quota Sampling:</b> Researchers ensure the sample reflects specific characteristics in predetermined proportions. <br>
        - <b>Purposive Sampling:</b> Participants are chosen based on specific criteria relevant to the study. <br>
