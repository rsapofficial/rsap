    <div class="chapter-4">
      <h2>Chapter 4: Data Analysis</h2><br>

      <h3 id="identify-your-research-questions">Identify your research questions</h3><br>
      <p>Research questions in both quantitative and qualitative research are questions that simplify the purpose
        statement down to particular questions that researchers seek to answer. In contrast to the simple and concise
        statement found in a purpose statement, researchers usually indicate several research questions in order to
        thoroughly investigate an issue. Research questions appear in both quantitative and qualitative studies, but
        their components may vary based on the type of study.</p><br>

      <h3 id="define-variables">Define variables you will be collecting and measuring</h3><br>
      <p>Before you jump into the actual data collection, take a moment to figure out exactly what you're looking for.
        Define the specific things you want to measure and collect. This upfront work is like setting the stage for your
        research. It ensures that you have a clear plan and know exactly what aspects you're investigating. Getting
        these details straight beforehand makes the data collection process smoother and ensures that you're focused on
        the right things. It sets you up for a more straightforward and reliable analysis later on, helping you get the
        most out of your research. This also allows you to formulate and validate research questions you will ask from
        your participants.</p><br>

      <h3 id="consider-procedures">Consider the procedures that will be used to filter out unnecessary data</h3><br>
      <p>Once you've collected data from your participants, it's important to give it a good read-through before diving
        into the analysis. This step helps filter out any information that might not be relevant. Essentially, you're
        making sure you're focusing on the important details and not getting sidetracked. This quick review is like a
        clean-up, ensuring that the analysis is based on the meaningful stuff and making the results more dependable.
      </p><br>

      <h3 id="specify-software-tools">Specify the quantitative software data analysis tools that will be used</h3><br>
      <p>Specify the tools you'll use for analyzing the data collected from your participants. This step is crucial
        because it outlines the methods and instruments that will translate raw data into meaningful insights. For
        instance, if you're dealing with survey responses, spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel can be handy for
        basic analyses and visualization. These tools help uncover patterns, relationships, or trends within the data,
        allowing you to draw informed conclusions. By stating the tools you'll use to analyze data, you're essentially
        showing how you'll turn raw information into useful insights. This clarity not only makes your research process
        transparent but also helps others understand and replicate your analysis, making your findings more credible.
      </p><br>

      <h3 id="conduct-variety-of-analyses">To describe, analyze, and summarize data, conduct a variety of analyses</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Examples of data analyses include the mean, which represents the average of values in a dataset, and the
        standard deviation, indicating the variation of other variables from the mean and emphasizing the potential
        impact of an intervention. These analyses are important because they help researchers understand the typical
        value in a dataset (mean) and how much individual data points vary from this average (standard deviation). For
        example, the mean gives you a central reference point, showing the typical value, while the standard deviation
        indicates how spread out the data is. In experiments or interventions, changes in the mean or an increase in
        standard deviation can signal an impact, providing valuable insights into the effectiveness of the intervention.
        So, these tools are crucial for uncovering patterns and making sense of research results.</p><br>

      <h3 id="discuss-types-of-tables">Discuss the various types of table that will be used to convey statistical
        reports</h3><br>

      <p>Explore the different types of tables that will be employed to present statistical reports. This is significant
        because the choice of tables plays a key role in conveying complex information in a clear and organized manner.
        Tables are visual aids that enhance the understanding of statistical data by providing a structured format for
        presenting numerical information. For instance, frequency tables can show the distribution of data, while
        comparative tables can highlight differences between groups or variables. By discussing the types of tables to
        be used, you're ensuring that your audience can easily comprehend and interpret the statistical findings,
        contributing to the effectiveness and accessibility of your research communication.</p><br>

      <h3>Steps in Compiling Data</h3><br>

      <i class="li">
        <p style="color: #DCF2F1; font-size: 14px; text-decoration: underline;">Note: The aforementioned steps in compiling statistical data is only
          suitable in using
          the latest version of Excel or/and WPS.</p>

      <h2>Chapter 5: Summary of findings, Conclusion, Recommendations</h2><br>
        <p style="color: #0F1035; font-size: 14px; text-decoration: underline;">Note: Start with an Introductory Statement consisting of only 2 sentences that includes the
          objective, purpose of the chapters and parts.</p><br>

      <h3 id="summary">Summary of findings</h3><br>
      <p>The Summary section serves as a concise overview of the research, encompassing
approximately two pages. It revisits the research's rationale, posing questions, defining scope, and outlining objectives. Following this, it articulates the research framework, model, or
hypothesis, detailing the research design and methods of data collection. <br><br>
        Moving on to the main findings, the Summary provides a brief presentation of outcomes
derived from data analysis. Without delving into statistical intricacies such as t-tests, the section
maintains brevity. It is crucial to revisit the initially set objectives and assess whether they were
accomplished. If objectives remain unmet, providing compelling reasons is essential. <br><br>
        The Summary intentionally refrains from introducing new elements, whether variables,
interpretations, or data. The focus remains on summarizing the descriptive analysis of all data, highlighting key discoveries from Chapter 4, and presenting an overarching summary of major
results.</p><br>
       <li class="li">Descriptive analysis of all data</li>
       <li class="li">Important findings based on the chapter 4</li>
       <li class="li">Summary of major results</li><br>

Recommended : 1-2 paragraphs (1 and 1/2 pages) 10 sentences</p></i><br>
      
      <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><br>
      <p>Conclusions aren’t simply an overview of a paper. Instead, they should reiterate why
your research is important. While it is helpful to include a brief summary, that is only the
beginning. If done well, conclusions can leave readers feeling both satisfied yet hungry for more. Effective conclusions help readers reflect on what they just read, draw connections to existing
knowledge, and spark their desire to further explore the subject. Ultimately, your conclusion
should help readers answer the following question: Why should I care about this topic?</p><br>
        <li class="li">keep it short. While there is no hard and fast rule on length, conclusions are typically
one paragraph long; however, you may find some that are two or three paragraphs
long.</li>
        <li class="li">Start with the statement "Based from the findings of the study, the following
conclusions were drawn:"</li>
        <li class="li">It should be on bulleted form</li><br>
        <i><p style="color: #0F1035; font-size: 14px; text-decoration: underline;">Note: Number of paragraphs are based on L2 or “Is there” questions in the SOP</p></i><br>
        
      <h3 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h3><br>
      <p>The final section of the concluding chapter may contain suggestions on how to extend
the work in future. <br><br>
        A good source of such suggestions is the limitations of your study. Here, you can
suggest one or two ways to overcome these limitations. When reviewing the literature, you may
also come across a related research gap that is not considered in your study. Similarly, in
analyzing the data, it may strike you that there is a different way to analyze the data. Being
creative is part of research (Ulibarri et al., 2019).</p><br>
      <li class="li">Start with the statement "Based from the conclusions of the study, the following are
recommended:"</li><br>
